# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
usin import math function,do the calculation.
### Step 2: 
Take the two coordinates as l1 and l2.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
using the print function,display the distance between the two points.
### Step 5: 
End the Program.
### PROGRAM:
  #Program to find the distance between two points.

import math
l1=[4,2]
l2=[10,6]
distance=math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))


### OUTPUT:
![ex 1c](https://github.com/Tanug25/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/assets/138849166/a0a87ee4-4665-434c-a493-a8d8eaf3b38b)


### RESULT:
Thus the distance of the two points is successfully executed and displayed.
